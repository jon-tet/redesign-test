*   **Risk Management**:  Introducing the new Risk Management page. Risks identified through Vulnerability Management scans and Attack Surface Management assessments are seamlessly integrated and will automatically populate the Risk Management page. Users can also manually create new risks as needed.  From this page, users can create and assign remediation tasks for identified risks.  Additionally, users have the ability to accept a risk, provide a business justification, and set an expiration date for the Risk Acceptance.
