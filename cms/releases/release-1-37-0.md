  **Calendar Page Enhancements**: We’ve improved visual clarity by adding a

  upgraded the overall design and functionality of the Calendar page and
  optimized the display of Remediation Descriptions for better readability.

  remediations for a cleaner view, and we’ve boosted dashboard performance by
  reducing unnecessary API calls from 5 to just 2 after login, making your
  experience faster and more efficient.

**Vendor Risk Management:** We’ve introduced a new Vendor Risk Management feature to help you effectively assess and manage the risks associated with your third-party vendors. The Vendor Risk Management summary widget on the Dashboard page provides a quick overview of vendor-related risks and directs you to the full Vendor Risk Management page for more detailed insights and actions. This feature streamlines your ability to track and mitigate vendor risks across your organization.

**Summary Sections**: Navigation just got easier! We’ve added clickable summary sections for Remediation Tracker, Risks, Identities, Assets, and Tools, providing quick and easy access to detailed information with just a click.
