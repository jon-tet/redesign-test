  The REDESIGN Team would like to cordially invite you to join us at Pinehills
  Golf Club for 18 holes and Dinner at East Bay Grille!


  First Tee Time goes out at 12 PM - please feel free to arrive early to warm up
  and enjoy some food and refreshments before we tee off!  
    
  Pinehills Golf Club is spectacularly set on over 300 acres of rolling hills
  punctuated by dramatic, glacially carved kettles and kames. Here, you’ll find
  two 18-hole championship courses designed by Rees Jones and Nicklaus Design.
  You’ll also enjoy our Clubhouse, offering gracious amenities and fine dining,
  as well as an array of elegant settings for special events, including golf
  outings, wedding receptions, and social gatherings.  
    
  **Food and Beverage**  
    
  We will wrap up the day with a family-style dinner at the East Bay Grille as
  our 19th hole. At East Bay Grille Pinehills, located at The Pinehills Golf
  Club in Plymouth, Massachusetts, we offer fine cuisine in a warm, yet casual
  environment. Our daily menu includes ocean fresh seafood, varietal pastas, and
  choice cut steaks, in addition to savory sandwiches and craft pizzettas. Get
  comfortable in our cozy Grille Room, relaxing veranda, or enjoy a cocktail
  around the fire pit. Whether you are just finishing a round of golf or
  enjoying a night out with family or friends, you can escape the everyday here
  at East Bay.
