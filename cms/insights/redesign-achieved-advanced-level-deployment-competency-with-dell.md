**El Segundo, CA, April 23, 2025** — [The Redesign Group](https://www.redesign-group.com/) (“Redesign”), a global technology and cybersecurity solutions provider and consulting firm has achieved the Advanced Level Deployment Competency with Dell through the coordinated efforts of their pre-sales and post-sales engineering teams.

Advanced Level Deployment status is reserved for the top 30% of all Dell Partners. By committing to a rigorous training initiative that significantly expanded their services competency capabilities, particularly within their delivery organization, and aligning closely with Dell’s Portfolio and Solutions Competencies on the pre-sales side, Redesign increased their certified offerings by over 200%. In tandem with these internal efforts, Redesign partnered closely with their Dell Channel Services representative to refine and enhance their reporting workflows.

**“Achieving the Advanced Level Deployment Competency is a direct reflection of the hard work and dedication our engineering teams bring to the table every day. This recognition underscores our commitment to delivering best-in-class solutions and setting the standard for technical excellence,” said Alex Payne, Director of Professional Services at Redesign.**

**"Partnering with Dell Technologies as a Global Titanium Partner is a deeply rewarding strategic alignment that we hold in the highest regard as a services organization. I’m incredibly proud of the hardworking individuals on our Delivery Services Team whose dedication and excellence have earned this well-deserved recognition,” added Alberto Mora, VP of Engineering and Delivery Services at Redesign.**
