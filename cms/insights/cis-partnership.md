Redesign has become an official member of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) SecureSuite. This means REDESIGN is now part of a selected group of companies that can utilize the CIS Controls framework to help companies build and manage their cybersecurity program against industry best practices.

The CIS harnesses the power of the global IT community to safeguard public and private organizations against cyber threats. The [CIS Critical Security Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls) (CIS Controls) are a prioritized set of Safeguards to mitigate the most prevalent cyber-attacks against systems and networks. They are mapped to and referenced by multiple legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks. CIS Controls v8 has been enhanced to keep up with modern systems and software. Movement to cloud-based computing, virtualization, mobility, outsourcing, work-from-home, and changing attacker tactics prompted the update and supports an enterprise’s security as they move to both fully cloud and hybrid environments.
